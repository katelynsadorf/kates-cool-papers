## ðŸ§  TL;DR
This paper presents a method for decoding intended arm movements from population activity in the motor cortex using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It outperforms linear decoders on curved trajectory prediction tasks.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Ideas
- RNNs trained on time-series data from electrode arrays can infer real-time motor intention.
- Training with simulated movement tasks improves robustness.
- The model integrates temporal context more effectively than traditional Kalman filters.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Like It
- The methods could be applied to closed-loop BMI for prosthetics.
- Shows strong potential for combining sequence models with neural interfaces.
