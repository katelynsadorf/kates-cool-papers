# About This Blog

Hi! Iâ€™m **Katelyn Sadorf**, a student at Caltech studying **Computer Science**, **Neurobiology**, and **Information & Data Sciences**. I'm passionate about the intersection of brains and machines â€” especially **neuro-inspired AI**, **brain-machine interfaces**, and **computational modeling of behavior and cognition**.

## Why This Blog Exists

I read a lot of technical papers â€” in ML, neuroscience, and interdisciplinary spaces like:
- Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs)
- Neural decoding and prosthetics
- Neuro-AI and biologically inspired deep learning
- Vision, attention, and behavior modeling

This blog is my way of:
- Synthesizing ideas from papers I read
- Reflecting on what I find exciting or confusing
- Sharing those thoughts publicly for others who might be curious too

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

Short blog-style posts that summarize and react to:
- New or classic research papers
- Experimental and computational methods in neuroscience
- Connections between AI architectures and brain function
- Occasional thoughts on the future of AI and cognition

Most posts are written informally but thoughtfully â€” I aim to learn in public.
